1️⃣ IS-A Relationship (Inheritance) : “IS-A represents inheritance where a subclass is a specialized form of its parent.”
What it means
IS-A = inheritance
If you can say “A is a B” and it always makes sense → IS-A

Implemented using:
    extends (class)
    implements (interface)
Enables polymorphism
Strong coupling

class Ride {
    calculateFare(distance) {
        throw new Error("Not implemented");
    }
}

class BikeRide extends Ride {
    calculateFare(distance) {
        return distance * 8;
    }
}

✔ BikeRide IS-A Ride . ✔ Valid inheritance

2️⃣ HAS-A Relationship (Composition) : “HAS-A represents composition where a class uses another class as a dependency.”
What it means
HAS-A = composition / aggregation

If you can say
“A has a B” → HAS-A

    Implemented by holding a reference
    More flexible than inheritance
    Preferred in LLD (composition over inheritance)

Example: Uber Ride HAS-A PaymentMethod
class Ride {
    private PaymentMethod paymentMethod;

    public Ride(PaymentMethod paymentMethod) {
        this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
    }

    public void pay(double amount) {
        paymentMethod.pay(amount);
    }
}

✔ Ride HAS-A PaymentMethod
✔ Payment method can change at runtime

5️⃣ Side-by-Side Comparison (Interview Table ⭐)
Aspect	                  IS-A	                  HAS-A
Meaning	                  Inheritance	            Composition
Keyword	                  extends / implements	  instance variable
Coupling	                Tight	                  Loose
Flexibility	              Low	                    High
LLD preference	          ⚠️ Careful	            ✅ Preferred



******************************************** Aggregation Vs Composition ***********************************************

1️⃣ Aggregation (Weak HAS-A)
What it means . Aggregation = “uses but does not own”
Child object can exist independently
Parent and child have separate life-cycles
Represented as a weak association

👉 Think: borrowed dependency
Uber Example: Ride Aggregates Driver
Driver exists even if ride is cancelled
Ride just refers to driver

class Driver {
    String name;
}
class Ride {
    private Driver driver;

    public Ride(Driver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}
✔ Driver exists independently
✔ Ride does not control driver life-cycle

2️⃣ Composition (Strong HAS-A) ⭐⭐⭐
What it means . Composition = “owns and manages”
Child object cannot exist without parent
Parent controls creation + destruction
Strong life-cycle dependency
👉 Think: part of

Swiggy Example: Order Composed of OrderItems
    OrderItems have no meaning without Order
    Deleting order deletes items

class OrderItem {
    String name;
    int quantity;

    OrderItem(String name, int quantity) {
        this.name = name;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
}
class Order {
    private List<OrderItem> items = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addItem(String name, int quantity) {
        items.add(new OrderItem(name, quantity));
    }
}
✔ Order creates OrderItem
✔ Order owns OrderItem

4️⃣ Visual Mental Model 🧠
Aggregation
Ride ─────▶ Driver

Composition
Order ◼────▶ OrderItem

(Black diamond = composition in UML)

5️⃣ Real Product Mapping (Interview Gold)
Order → OrderItem → Composition
Order → DeliveryPartner → Aggregation
Restaurant → Menu → Composition
Restaurant → Address → Aggregation

8️⃣ One-Line Interview Answers ⭐

Aggregation: “Aggregation represents a HAS-A relationship where the child object has an independent life-cycle.”
Composition: “Composition represents a strong HAS-A relationship where the child object’s life-cycle is bound to the parent.”

UML - Unified Modelling Language 
UML is a standardized visual language to design and communicate system structure and behavior.

UML Diagram Categories
UML diagrams are broadly divided into 2 categories:

1️⃣ Structural Diagrams (Static view)
👉 Show structure of the system

2️⃣ Behavioral Diagrams (Dynamic view)
👉 Show how system behaves over time

1️⃣ Structural UML Diagrams (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔥 1. Class Diagram (MOST IMPORTANT)
What it shows
    Classes
    Fields
    Methods
    Relationships

Example (Order system)
+------------------+
|     Order        |
+------------------+
| - orderId        |
| - status         |
+------------------+
| + confirm()      |
| + cancel()       |
+------------------+

Symbols
Symbol	        Meaning
+	              public
-	              private
#	              protected

Relationships (Interview Gold ⭐)
1️⃣ Association
Order -------- Customer
➡ “Order is associated with Customer”

2️⃣ Aggregation (Weak HAS-A)
Ride ◇------ Driver
➡ White diamond
➡ Driver exists independently

3️⃣ Composition (Strong HAS-A)
Order ◆------ OrderItem
➡ Black diamond
➡ Order owns OrderItem

4️⃣ Inheritance (IS-A)
BikeRide ───▷ Ride
➡ Hollow triangle arrow

5️⃣ Interface Implementation
UpiPayment ──▷ PaymentMethod
➡ Dashed line + hollow triangle


2️⃣ Behavioral UML Diagrams
🔥 1. Sequence Diagram (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
What it shows
      Method calls
      Order of interactions
      Time flow (top → bottom)

Example: Swiggy Order Placement
      User → OrderController → OrderService → PaymentService

Symbols
Symbol	                        Meaning
Vertical line	                  Lifeline
Solid arrow	                    Sync call
Dashed arrow	                  Return
Activation bar	                Method execution
