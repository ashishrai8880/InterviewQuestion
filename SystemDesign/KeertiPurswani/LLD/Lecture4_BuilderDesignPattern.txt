1. Builder Design Pattern 
Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
It separates object construction from object representation, allowing you to create different variants of an object using the
same construction process .

“Builder pattern is used when an object has many optional parameters or complex construction logic, and we want readable, 
flexible, and immutable object creation.”

----- First: What problem are we really solving?

Imagine you have an object with many fields:
        Some are required
        Some are optional
        Different use cases need different combinations

Example : Some are required and some are optional
HttpRequest(
  url,
  method,
  headers,
  queryParams,
  body,
  timeout,
  authToken,
  retryCount,
  cacheEnabled
)

new HttpRequest(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)
Problems:
        You don’t know what f or g means
        Easy to swap values accidentally
        Adding a new field breaks many places

This is called the Telescoping Constructor Problem.

Option 2: Multiple constructors
        HttpRequest(url, method)
        HttpRequest(url, method, headers)
        HttpRequest(url, method, headers, body)
        HttpRequest(url, method, headers, body, timeout)

Problems:
        Too many constructors
        Hard to maintain
        Still confusing

Option 3: Setters (common but dangerous)
HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
req.setUrl(url);
req.setMethod(method);
req.setTimeout(30);

Problems:
        Object can be in invalid state
        Not immutable
        Easy to forget required fields

HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.builder()
    .url("api/users")
    .method("POST")
    .timeout(30)
    .build();

What problem Builder solves (in ONE LIST)

Builder pattern solves:
          Too many constructor parameters
          Unreadable object creation
          Invalid or half-built objects
          Need for immutability
          Complex creation logic
