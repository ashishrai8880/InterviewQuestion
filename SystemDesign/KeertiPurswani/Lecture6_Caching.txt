    * Locality of Reference means programs often reuse the same data or nearby instructions rather than accessing random memory locations.
    * Locality of reference is the property of a program that describes how memory references are grouped together in time and space during execution.

    Two Types of locality of referecne 

      1. Temporal Locality : Temporal locality states that if a particular memory location (data or instruction) is accessed at one time, it is likely to be accessed again in the near future.
      2. Spatial Locality : Spatial locality states that if a particular memory location is accessed, the nearby memory locations are also likely to be accessed soon. Instructions and data are
            stored in contiguous memory locations.
