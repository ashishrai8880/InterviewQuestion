📌 What is Base62?
Base62 is an encoding scheme that uses a set of 62 characters to represent data. These characters include:

26 lowercase letters: a–z
26 uppercase letters: A–Z
10 digits: 0–9

🔤 Base62 Character Set
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
In total: 10 (digits) + 26 (uppercase) + 26 (lowercase) = 62 characters

✅ Key Properties of Base62
URL-safe: No special characters like +, /, or =.
Compact: Encoded strings are short and readable.
No padding required.
Common in short URLs, unique ID generation, and compact representations.
🧮 How Base62 Works (Example)
Let’s say you want to convert a decimal number like 125 into Base62:

Divide the number by 62, get the quotient and remainder:
125 ÷ 62 = 2 remainder 1
2 ÷ 62 = 0 remainder 2
Now, reverse the remainders: 2, 1

Lookup the character set:

2 → '2'
1 → '1'
🔁 Final Base62 string = 21

To decode 21 back:

2 = value 2, 1 = value 1
(2 × 62) + 1 = 125

================================================== 🔐 What is Base64?  ======================================================
Base64 is another encoding system — widely used in email encoding, image representation in HTML/CSS, binary-to-text encoding in APIs, etc.

🔤 Base64 Character Set
26 uppercase letters: A–Z
26 lowercase letters: a–z
10 digits: 0–9
2 symbols: + and /
Padding symbol: = (optional but often used)
Total: 64 characters

📥 Input-Output Format
Takes 3 bytes (24 bits) of binary data.
Encodes them into 4 Base64 characters (each 6 bits).

🧩 Other Similar Encodings
🔹 Base58
Used in Bitcoin addresses (excludes confusing characters like 0, O, I, l)

58 characters: A-Z, a-z, 1–9 (without confusing ones)
No 0, O, I, l
Safer for manual entry
🔹 Base36
Characters: 0-9, A-Z
Often used for compact alphanumeric representations.
Easier math, good for small-scale encoding.

===============================================================================================================
🔹 Base85 (Ascii85, Z85)
Uses 85 printable characters.
More efficient than Base64 (encoded size ~25% smaller)
More complex and less human-readable.
🔹 Base32
Only 32 characters: A-Z, 2–7
Used in QR codes, DNS, etc.
More error-tolerant (case-insensitive)
