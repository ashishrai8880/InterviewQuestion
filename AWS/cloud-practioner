Traditional Infra -> You own everything or rent it out .
There are government cloud also whcih is completely seperate from other . 

-> Types of Cloud Service
1. Infrastructure as a service (IAAS) -> OS Level responsibility . eg : ec2 .
  What it is: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  Users manage: Applications, data, runtime, middleware, and OS.
  Providers manage: Virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.
  Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2) , Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines , Google Compute Engine

2. Platform as a service (PAAS)-> code level resposibility . eg : AWS elastic beanstalk , azure webapps .
  What it is: Offers a development and deployment environment for applications.
  Users manage: Applications and data.
  Providers manage: Everything else including OS, middleware, runtime, and infrastructure.
  Examples:Google App Engine , Microsoft Azure App Services ,Heroku

3. Software as a service (SAAS) -> Consumer eg : twitter . 
  What it is: Delivers fully functional applications over the internet.
  Users manage: Only usage and configuration.
  Providers manage: Everything else (application, data, infrastructure).
  Examples: Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets) , Microsoft 365 , Salesforce

4. Function as a Service (FaaS) / Serverless
  What it is: A model where developers deploy code in response to events without managing servers.
  Users manage: Only the code and event triggers.
  Providers manage: Entire infrastructure and scaling.
  Examples: AWS Lambda , Azure Functions , Google Cloud Functions

 ============================Types of Cloud Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud
Definition: Cloud services offered over the internet by third-party providers.
Owned and operated by: Providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
Resources: Shared among multiple customers ("multi-tenant").
Pros: Cost-effective, scalable, no maintenance.
Cons: Less control, data security concerns for sensitive workloads.

2. Private Cloud
Definition: Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization.
Owned and operated by: Either the company itself or a third-party exclusively for one client.
Resources: Used by one organization only.
Pros: High security and control.
Cons: Expensive and complex to manage.

3. Hybrid Cloud
Definition: A mix of public and private clouds with integration between them.
Use Case: Keep sensitive data in a private cloud and use public cloud for less critical workloads.
Pros: Flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability.
Cons: Complex integration and management.

4. Multi-Cloud
Definition: Using services from multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS + Azure + GCP).
Purpose: Avoid vendor lock-in, use best-of-breed services.
Pros: Redundancy, flexibility, optimization.
Cons: Complex governance and security management.

===================================================üß± Core Components of AWS Global Infrastructure ===============================================================
1. Regions
Definition: A geographic area (e.g., US East, Europe, Asia Pacific). Regions are inter connected with AWS network .
Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones.
AWS has over 30 regions globally (and more coming).
‚úÖ You choose which region to run your applications in.

2. Availability Zones (AZs)
Definition: Physically separate data centers within a region.
Each region has at least 2 to 6 AZs, designed for high availability.
AZs are isolated but connected with low-latency, high-speed links.
Example: US East (N. Virginia) has 6 AZs.

3. Edge Locations
Definition: Data centers used by Amazon CloudFront (AWS‚Äôs CDN) to cache content closer to users.
Located in hundreds of cities worldwide.
Improve performance and reduce latency for content delivery.

4. Local Zones
Definition: Extensions of a region placed near large population or business centers.
Designed to run latency-sensitive applications closer to end-users.

5. Wavelength Zones
Definition: Infrastructure placed at telecom providers‚Äô networks to deliver ultra-low latency for 5G apps.
Used for things like real-time gaming, AR/VR, or autonomous vehicles.

6. AWS Outposts
Definition: Physical racks of AWS hardware installed on-premises (in your own data center).
Extends AWS infrastructure and services to private or hybrid cloud environments.

==========================üß© AWS Shared Responsibility Model Responsibility Breakdown =======================================================
1. AWS (Cloud Provider) ‚Äì "Security of the Cloud"
AWS is responsible for securing the infrastructure that runs all the services offered in the AWS Cloud:
Physical security of data centers
Hardware, networking, and facilities
Software for compute, storage, and database services
Global infrastructure (Regions, AZs, Edge Locations)

2. Customer (You) ‚Äì "Security in the Cloud"
You are responsible for managing everything you put into the cloud and how you configure it:
Data (encryption, classification)
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Applications
OS and network configurations (for IaaS)
Firewall settings
Client-side encryption
UserData , encryption , scaling , ec2 and lot more is user responsibility

A. Maintaining the physical security of AWS data centers
B. Managing access to data stored in Amazon S3
C. Securing the underlying hypervisor
D. Monitoring network infrastructure

‚úÖ Answer: B

‚ùìQuestion 2:

A. Configuring security group rules
B. Updating the firmware on host servers
C. Enforcing multi-factor authentication for users
D. Physical security of data centers
E. Encrypting customer data

‚úÖ Answers: B and D
