‚úÖ Answers: B and D

 ==============================================‚úÖ Topic: What is AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)? =================================================
üîπ Definition:
AWS IAM is a free AWS service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources.

It allows you to:
Create and manage users and groups
Assign permissions to allow or deny access to AWS resources
Use policies to define who can do what (e.g., read S3, start EC2)
Role  : role can be assigned to user , service and application . It is like 1 day prime minister . and if any user assigned any role , then it will be overcome over user's group 
assgined policy . 

Root User should be avoided and there is no way to reduce its permssion . Newly created user has not permission by default until it is assigned to some group 
One can create upto 5000 account or user . There can be more but after raising request to AWS . 

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a unique identifier for an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance, S3 bucket, or IAM user. It's a string of characters that
specifies the resource's location and other identifying information within the AWS ecosystem. ARNs are crucial for unambiguously referencing resources across AWS,
especially in scenarios like IAM policies, API calls, and resource tagging

There always should be least priviledge possible or policy to any user . IAM policies are JSON documented . 

üõ°Ô∏è Key Features of IAM
Feature	Description
Users	Individual accounts for people or applications
Groups	Collections of users with shared permissions
Roles	Temporary access permissions for users/services (no credentials needed)
Policies	JSON documents that define what actions are allowed or denied
MFA (Multi-Factor Auth)	Adds extra layer of security to user logins
Federation	Allows users from external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Google) to access AWS

üîë Exam-Relevant Points
IAM is global (not tied to a region)
IAM allows granular permissions (per service, per action)
IAM is free
Root user has full access ‚Äî should be protected and rarely used
IAM roles are used by AWS services or external users to assume temporary access

üìå Sample Exam Questions
‚ùìQuestion 1:
What does AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enable you to do?

A. Automatically scale AWS resources
B. Securely control access to AWS services and resources
C. Monitor AWS usage across regions
D. Encrypt data in transit
‚úÖ Answer: B

‚ùìQuestion 2:
Which IAM entity is used to grant temporary access to AWS resources?

A. IAM User
B. IAM Policy
C. IAM Role
D. IAM Group
‚úÖ Answer: C

‚ùìQuestion 3:
Which of the following is a best practice for the AWS root user account?

A. Use it for everyday tasks
B. Disable it completely
C. Share it with your team
D. Enable MFA and use only when necessary
‚úÖ Answer: D

 ==========================================================üîπ Main Types of AWS Policies ===========================================================
1. Identity-Based Policies (Most Common)
Attached to: IAM users, groups, or roles
Purpose: Grant permissions to users or roles
Examples: Allow a user to access Amazon S3 , Deny EC2 access for a grou
üü¢ You define and manage these.

2. Resource-Based Policies
Attached to: AWS resources directly (e.g., an S3 bucket, SNS topic)
Purpose: Specify who (which users, accounts, or services) can access that specific resource
Examples: An S3 bucket policy that allows another AWS account to read from the bucket . An SNS topic policy allowing Lambda to publish messages
üü¢ Often used for cross-account access.

3. Permissions Boundaries
Attached to: IAM users or roles
Purpose: Define the maximum permissions an identity-based policy can grant . Permission boundaries actually do not grant permission . Ye bas boundaries set karta hai . 
like ec2 me user 2-3 cheeze kar sakta hai . ab ye permission boundaries set karne k baad , user bas ec2 me hi kuch kar sakta hai . s3 , lambda ya koi or service me kuch 
nahi kar sakta . isse bas boundaries set karte hai . actual me ye permissioin deta nahii h kisi ko . 
Think of this as a "permissions ceiling" ‚Äî you can‚Äôt go beyond it even if other policies allow more.
üü¢ Used for advanced access control, especially in large orgs.

4. Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Attached to: AWS Organizations organizational units (OUs) or accounts . It is same as permission boundaries ,but at large level . if there is more than 1 organisation 
then basically one can set its policies to its sub organisational units . If i give permission that particular sub organisation unit can just create 5 ec2 , then that 
sub organisation will be able to just create 5 ec2 not more than that . 
Purpose: Set permission guardrails across multiple accounts
Can allow or deny certain actions regardless of the IAM policies in those accounts.
üü¢ Only available when using AWS Organizations

5. Session Policies
Used with: Temporary credentials (like when using STS AssumeRole)
Purpose: Provide temporary, scoped-down permissions for a session
Useful for fine-grained, temporary access

6. ACL (Access Control Policies )
Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. It defines
which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. When a request is received against a resource, Amazon S3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify
that the requester has the necessary access permissions. It is first policies which do not use JSON format . Also ACL is like resource based policy but it can be use accross
different aws accounts . Like s3 bucket , we can give access to different account by using ACL . 

Best Practice of IAM 
1. use MFA
2. Rotate keys and password . Do not use root user account . 
3. Least priviledge permission . 
4. IAM access analyzer -> tool to generate least priviledge policy based on access activity
5. Regulary remove user , role , permissioin , policy and credentials .
6. condition like IP range and geo location can be applied .

Which AWS storage option is best suited for storing long-term, infrequently accessed backups?

A. Amazon S3
B. Amazon EFS
C. Amazon FSx
D. Amazon S3 Glacier

‚úÖ Answer: D

======================================================== Types of Storage Service in AWS ================================================================
1. EBS Elastic Block Store (SSD/HDD) - OS can be installed over it . It is attached to EC2 . It can be attached to only 1 EC2 machine . 1 EC2 machine can have multiple 
      EBS attached with it .  EC2 and EBS should be in same availability zone . it should not in different AZs . 

      Nowadays , AWS is trying to give multi attach EBS , means one EBS can be shared among multiple instance . cool and optimized but need lot configuration . 

      Since EBS attached with EC2 , so when ec2 instance deleted , it will also get deleted . 
2. EFS : which is already discussed above . It is basically shared drive which can be used by multiple instance . 
3. S3 : Object Storage . Stores everything in object format . like images, backups, data lakes. Very scalable.
      It uses http protocol to access and upload data over it .  



 =============================================================‚úÖ Topic 1: EBS Snapshots ===============================================================
üîπ What is an EBS Snapshot?
An EBS Snapshot is a backup of your EBS volume (like a disk image). It captures the state of the volume at a specific point in time and stores it in Amazon S3.
Think of it as taking a picture of your disk so you can restore it later if needed.

üß† Key Features:
Feature	Description
Incremental	Only the first snapshot is full; others store changes
Stored in S3	But not directly accessible via S3
Used for backup & restore	Can restore volume from a snapshot anytime
Manual or automatic	Snapshots can be created manually or via automation

üîß Common Use Cases:
Backup EC2 volumes before updates

Restore corrupted disks

Create new EBS volumes in other regions from a snapshot

‚úÖ Topic 2: Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)
üîπ What is DLM?
AWS Data Lifecycle Manager is a tool that automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS Snapshots based on policies you define.
Instead of manually creating and deleting snapshots, DLM does it on a schedule for you.

üß† Key Features:
Feature	Description
Automated Snapshots	Create policies to take snapshots on a schedule
Retention Rules	Automatically delete old snapshots after a certain number/days
Tag-based management	Apply policies to volumes with specific tags
Cost optimization	Helps prevent over-paying for unused snapshots

üîß Example:
You create a policy to:
Take snapshots of all volumes tagged Environment:Production
Every 12 hours
Keep only the last 7 snapshots

DLM handles this automatically ‚Äî no manual work needed!

üîÅ EBS Snapshots + DLM Workflow:
You create an EBS volume and attach it to an EC2 instance
You want regular backups ‚Äî so you set up a DLM policy
DLM automatically takes snapshots and deletes old ones per your rules

üìå Sample Exam Questions
‚ùìQuestion 1:
What is the purpose of an EBS snapshot in AWS?

A. To improve EC2 performance
B. To archive data directly to Glacier

A. They automatically compress your data
B. They store only changes since the last snapshot, reducing cost
C. They require no storage in S3
D. They run only on EC2 with EFS

‚úÖ Answer: B


==========================================================‚úÖ Topic: AWS Instance Store =============================================================
üîπ What is it?

=================================================Amazon S3 Gateway ==========================================

Amazon S3 Gateway is part of AWS Storage Gateway, a hybrid cloud storage service that enables on-premises applications to
seamlessly use cloud storage like Amazon S3. It helps integrate on-premises environments with AWS cloud storage for backup,
archiving, and disaster recovery.

There are three types of AWS Storage Gateway:

1.File Gateway:

Allows you to store and retrieve files in Amazon S3, but with the ability to interact with files through a file system
interface.
It appears as a file share on-premises, but the data is actually stored in S3.

2.Volume Gateway:

Presents cloud storage volumes as iSCSI devices, enabling you to back up and store data on Amazon S3 or in Amazon Elastic
Block Store (EBS).

3.Tape Gateway:

Provides a virtual tape library (VTL) interface for backup applications. It stores virtual tapes in Amazon S3, 
facilitating long-term backup storage in the cloud.

S3 Gateway use cases:

Backing up on-premises data to Amazon S3.
Archiving data to S3 without requiring direct internet access.
Integrating file-based workflows with cloud storage.

==========> Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration
S3 Transfer Acceleration is a service designed to speed up the transfer of files into and out of Amazon S3, especially when 
uploading data from geographically distant locations.
It leverages Amazon CloudFront‚Äôs globally distributed edge locations to accelerate data transfer by routing your data 
to the nearest edge location, which then forwards it to your S3 bucket. This process significantly reduces latency, 
especially for large files or when uploading from regions far from the bucket‚Äôs location.

How it works:
When you enable S3 Transfer Acceleration, AWS creates a unique URL for your S3 bucket 
(e.g., bucketname.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com).

Data is uploaded to the nearest CloudFront edge location.

The data is then forwarded over optimized network paths to the destination S3 bucket.

Key Benefits:
Faster uploads, especially for large files.
Reduces transfer times across large geographical distances.
No need to modify applications or clients.
Great for situations where the users are far from the S3 region.

====================================================== DRS (Amazon Elastic Disaster Recovery) =====================
AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (often abbreviated as AWS DRS) is a service designed to help you quickly recover your 
applications and data after a disaster. It provides the ability to replicate on-premises and cloud-based applications
to AWS with minimal downtime and recovery point objectives (RPOs).

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery simplifies disaster recovery for organizations by replicating critical workloads into AWS, 
allowing fast failover when necessary, and minimizing downtime in case of system failures, network disruptions, or other 
disaster events.

Key Features of AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery:
Continuous Replication:
AWS DRS continuously replicates data from your on-premises infrastructure or other cloud environments to AWS. This
minimizes the risk of data loss during a disaster.

Low Recovery Time Objective (RTO):
AWS DRS ensures that the recovery time (RTO) is low, meaning applications can be restored quickly in the event of an 
outage or disaster.

Non-Disruptive:
The service operates without interrupting your running workloads. You can continue running your production systems while
AWS DRS replicates them in the background.

Automated Orchestrated Failover:
AWS DRS can automate the failover process, making it easier to initiate the recovery of applications in the AWS cloud.

Minimal Impact on Performance:
The replication process has minimal impact on the performance of your production workloads, as AWS DRS uses lightweight 
agents and incremental replication.

Application Consistency:
AWS DRS ensures that your applications are application-consistent at the time of recovery, meaning the data is in a
consistent state for applications that require specific data integrity (e.g., databases).

Integration with AWS Services:
It integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), to 
facilitate the recovery process.

Cost-Effective:
Only pay for the resources you use during the disaster recovery process, which helps lower costs compared to traditional
disaster recovery solutions.

Use Cases for AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery:
Disaster Recovery for Critical Workloads:
Ensures that mission-critical applications, databases, and workloads are replicated to AWS for fast recovery in the event 
of system failure, natural disaster, or cybersecurity attack.

Migrations with Minimal Downtime:
Can be used as part of a migration strategy where you replicate on-premises systems to AWS before cutting over to the
cloud, ensuring minimal downtime during the transition.

Testing and Compliance:
Allows you to conduct disaster recovery tests without impacting your production systems. It also helps meet compliance 
requirements for business continuity.

Business Continuity:
Provides peace of mind for business continuity, ensuring that organizations can quickly recover from failures and resume
operations with minimal disruption.
