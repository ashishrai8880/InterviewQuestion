1. What is elastic search and how does it work ?

Ans : Elastic Search is open source full text search engine that works on both structured and unstructured data as well . At its core, Elasticsearch is used to perform fast 
searches on large datasets and to analyze complex data, providing quick responses to queries.

Key Features of Elasticsearch:
Full-text Search: Elasticsearch excels at full-text searching, making it ideal for scenarios like searching documents, logs, and other text-heavy data.
Scalability: It can scale horizontally by adding more nodes (servers) to a cluster, allowing it to handle growing amounts of data efficiently.
Real-time Indexing: Data can be indexed and made searchable almost immediately, making it suitable for real-time applications.
Distributed System: Elasticsearch is designed to be distributed, so it can spread data across multiple machines for redundancy and speed.
Restful API: It uses RESTful APIs and JSON, making it easy to integrate with applications and services over HTTP.
Powerful Querying: Elasticsearch provides a powerful querying language, allowing users to perform complex searches like filtering, aggregation, and full-text searches.

When anyone make any request on elastic search for any product , it will give score to every related product and according to that it fetches result . 

Elasticsearch: It is purpose-built for full-text search, and includes a wide range of specialized features like full-text search with scoring, ranking of results by relevance, 
tokenization, stemming, synonyms handling, and fuzzy search. This makes it much more powerful for tasks like searching product descriptions, customer reviews, and other text-heavy data.


**************Important point which is difference between db search and elastic search .***********************
1. Advanced Full-Text Search
In an e-commerce context, users search for products by typing keywords into a search box. These search terms may not exactly match product titles or descriptions, but Elasticsearch
can handle fuzzy search, synonyms, stemming (e.g., "running shoes" vs. "run shoe"), and misspelled words (e.g., "sneekers" vs. "sneakers").
Example: Imagine a user searching for "blue running shoes". In a traditional NoSQL database, the query might only return products with an exact match for those words.
In Elasticsearch, it would return relevant products even if the user typed "blues running shoes" or "sneakers" instead of "shoes".

2. Relevance Scoring and Ranking
Elasticsearch uses sophisticated relevance scoring to rank results, based on factors such as text matches, keyword frequency, product ratings, and popularity. 
This ensures that the most relevant products show up first.
In MongoDB, ranking products by relevance would require custom logic and would likely be slower, especially as the dataset grows.

There are 5 things in Elastic Stack . Elastic is company name . 
1. Elastic Search : open source full text search
2. Kibana : Dashboard UI
3. Log Stash : It takes data from source and store /patak in elastic search

There are 2 ways to find data first one is through API request and second one is through terminal .
