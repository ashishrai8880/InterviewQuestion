1. What is difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause ?
Ans : In SQL, the WHERE and HAVING clauses are essential for filtering data and refining query results. While both 
serve the purpose of applying conditions, they are used at different stages of query execution and for distinct purposes.

-> WHERE : WHERE Clause is used to filter the records from the table or used while joining more than one table. Only those
records will be extracted who are satisfying the specified condition in the WHERE clause. It can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, 
and DELETE statements. It is applied before any grouping or aggregation occurs in a query .

SELECT S_Name, Age 
FROM Student 
WHERE Age >=18

-> HAVING : HAVING Clause is used to filter the records from the groups based on the given condition in the HAVING Clause.
Those groups who will satisfy the given condition will appear in the final result. It is applied after the grouping and
aggregation of data.

SELECT Age, COUNT(Roll_No) AS No_of_Students 
FROM Student GROUP BY Age
HAVING COUNT(Roll_No) > 1 

 The WHERE clause filters rows before any grouping or aggregation occurs. The HAVING clause filters grouped data after aggregation.
