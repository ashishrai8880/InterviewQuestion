1. What is Kafka and how to implement it in NodeJs ?
Ans.  Apache Kafka is a powerful distributed streaming platform that enables real-time data processing and stream processing applications.
 It has low latency and high throughput .

Zookeeper : Zookeeper manages kafka cluster and coordinated with distributed application . It keeps tracks of nodes in Kafka cluster . It maintains list of kafka topics and messages .

In Kafka , there is one producer , who produces data in some period of time . Then Kafka server published that data to all the subscribers . 

Service A : There will be one API endpoint suppose   /save-location  METHOD : POST -> This API will save live location of delivery boy to Kafka Cluster . It will get live location from frontend .

Service B : There will be consumer of message . When producer sends anything , it will receive it immediately . 

Summary of the Flow:
Driver sends location updates via an API.  -> to server A .
The API sends the data to the Kafka Producer.    -> through server A
Kafka streams the data to a consumer service.    -> through server A
The consumer service processes and stores the data.   -> through server B
The end user (rider) can receive updates via:
Polling the API (less efficient, more load)  -> through server B to client with Socket connection 
WebSockets/SSE (more efficient, real-time)
