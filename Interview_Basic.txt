I have solved more than 250 question of dsa on gfg and 140+ question on leetcode and secured 5 star and gold level badge on hackerrank . 

In my current role , I have been focusing more on backend development for a project in tour and travel industry . My strength is , I am good in logics and problem solving skills . I like to solve DSA . My weakeness is , I feels uncomfortable until I complete my task . Also , ocassionaly take on multiple tasks simultaneously , which makes me stressed . To address this , I have been improving my priritization and timing management skills to ensure I focus on the most important tasks .

We basically have 3 platform , customer facing , admin crm and agent portal . My primary focus is on backend developement using Nodejs . I have worked in invoice module and implemented OAuth 2.0 .

2. Describe project which you have worked on ?

Ans ==>  I have worked on 4 project till now . Starting from 1st project . First project was Node Bridge System . 

First Project is Node Bridge System => Initially API is built is PHP YII framework . In this for a particular movie/asset detail , the data came from different table and then we structured it's response and then send response to client . Because of this , one API required a lot of db hits . That's why we created Node API bridge . In this , we have already stored the response of assets/movie in seperate database . This project runs every 10 minutes as a CRON services . 

Second Project Node API 2.0 => Second project is all about API services and related to first project . Now whenever a request comes for any movies/assets , the response comes directly from previos saved response in database . We have also used redis caching , where we stored response of first time request in redis . and second time if request comes for same assets we directly serve response from redis . which makes response time even more faster . 

Third Project Digivive CMS => Content Management System where we provide facility for client to upload their content to their own OTT platform . In this project , I have worked mostly on frontend side . Where I have implemented permission system in entire application using CASL library . There are basically 4 level of user . Second I have created dynamic form which provide flexibility to client to add/remove field in content .

Fourth Project ONRG => In this project , we provide researcher to upload whitepaper , and then Get insights from that whitepaper using some AI tools . We have made CRON jobs which runs in every minute to process whitepaper from AI tools , and then get insights like its relevancy from challenge , author detail , author other work area , author area of interest from whitepaper . 

3. Do you have any question to ask ?
Ans . Which technology are company using in backend of this project . 

4. What challenge you faced while working on this project ?
Ans . The main challenge I faced was the optimisatioin of API . Earlier we were using aggregation query and in aggregation query , Joining of collection takes more number of line of code . Later on , we realised that we should use traditional find() method with populate query , which reduce no. of lines of code 10 times and response times .
