Steps for Install Jenkins on AWS EC2 Instance
 ==> If already installed first remove it
	sudo systemctl stop jenkins
	sudo apt purge jenkins -y
	sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins /var/log/jenkins /var/cache/jenkins /etc/default/jenkins /etc/init.d/jenkins

==> Remove java
	sudo apt purge openjdk-* -y
	sudo apt autoremove -y

==> Remove Docker
	sudo systemctl stop docker
	sudo apt purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
	sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker /etc/docker

==> Remove Nodejs
	sudo apt purge nodejs npm -y
	sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules

==>  Clean up apt cache
	sudo apt autoremove -y
	sudo apt clean

==> After cleanup : After Cleanup
You can verify everything is gone by running:

	which jenkins
	which java
	which docker
	which node

==> Jenkins Installation on AWS EC2 Ubuntu
ğŸ§± Prerequisites (Assumptions):
Ubuntu EC2 instance is running

You are connected via SSH

Port 8080 is open in your EC2 Security Group (important for accessing Jenkins)

	1. sudo apt update

	2. sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
	3. java -version

	4. Add Jenkins GPG key and repository (2024 method)

		curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  		/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

		echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  		https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  		/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

ğŸ”¹ 5. Install Jenkins

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install jenkins -y

ğŸ”¹ 6. Start and enable Jenkins service

	sudo systemctl start jenkins
	sudo systemctl enable jenkins
	sudo systemctl status jenkins.service  - for viewing jenkins status

ğŸ”¹ 7. Access Jenkins in browser

	http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080

 ğŸ”¹8. Get the Jenkins initial admin password

	sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Above command will install jenkins in aws ec2 instance ubuntu . Now you can open jenkins url in browser and set 
configuration . 

===> Generate AWS EC2 ssh key by command

	ssh-keygen

this command will generate 2 keys , public and private . 

----------------------------------------- Connecting Github With Jenkins---------------------------------

1. First go to the setting in github and add ssh keys . Add aws ec2 public key in github ssh keys . and save it
2. Go to jenkins and click on New (+) on top right corner . This will ask for cicd type . 
3. Select Freestyle project and go ahead . Then type description and all . In Source code management select 
	GIT and then add credentials . Here in key , add aws ec2 private key . ID will be 'ubuntu' or whatever username
	is . And Then save button 

4. Now Jenkins will get connected with Github . 
5. Now when you click on build button , it will fetch entire repository , and will give you location of that
repo . 

At this point you have to restart your node application manually by going to terminal and entering required command . 

-------------------------------------------Containarisation of APP ---------------------------------------

=> First install docker in your machine by running command 

	sudo apt install docker.io

1. Write Dockerfile code . 

	# Node Base Image
	FROM node:12.2.0-alpine

	#Working Directry
	WORKDIR /node

	#Copy the Code
	COPY . .

	#Install the dependecies
	RUN npm install
	RUN npm run test
	EXPOSE 8000

	#Run the code
	CMD ["node","app.js"]

2. Run below command and make image of application . Below command will make available of every software requirement
for application . 

	docker build . -t node-todo-app .

Above command can create permission denied issue . You can run below command for this . 
	sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

3. Now run below command to run application

	docker run -d --name todo-node-app -p 8000:8000 node-todo-app

Above 3 command will run your application . 

Above command might create permission issue while running . Please visit stackoverflow for this . for this you can 
try below command . 

	sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins (This will resolve permission issue)

By following above command , you will be able to run application in docker , but still you have to run these command
everytime manually in shell . To automate this , you can paste these command in jenkins configure option . 

You can go to configure option , and then scroll down and then select 'execute shell' from build steps dropdown

Paste docker command there . 

Now there might be issue of duplicate name of docker container after running second build which is normal . 
For this you can write : docker rm -f todo_app_node || true : at the top of build script shell 

Final will be : 
	docker rm -f todo_app_node || true
	docker build . -t node-todo-app
	docker run -d --name todo_app_node -p 8000:8000 node-todo-app



----------------------------------- Automation of pulling from github -----------------------------------

1. First install github-integration plugins in jenkins . 

2. Go to the repo settings . And then add webhook . And save it .

	http://ec2-instance-ip:8080/github-webhook/

3. Go to the jenkins configure screen and scroll down and there is Triggers . Select "GitHub hook trigger for 
GITScm polling" and save it . Now whenever there is change in mentioned branch in jenkins , build will 
automatically get triggered . 

------------------------------------- Master and Slave Node --------------------------------------------------
Master Node: In Jenkins, the master node is responsible for managing the overall Jenkins instance, scheduling jobs, managing user permissions, and overseeing the build pipelines.
It shouldn't be overloaded with actual build tasks because if the master node is busy with heavy tasks, it can affect its core functionality (like job scheduling and management).

Agent Nodes: These are separate, dedicated machines (or virtual machines/containers) where Jenkins can offload the actual work (builds, tests, deployments). Having dedicated agent
nodes for builds and deployments keeps the master node free for its management responsibilities.

===> Steps
1. First create dedicated instance for jenkins agent node . 
2. Jenkins should be installed in master node and it is not necessary to install it in child node . But child node should installed java init . 
3. Now parent node will connect to child using ssh . Master will contain private key and child will contain public key . 
   In Master node : cd ~/.ssh
	Create keys :  ssh key-gen
	Copy public key .
4.  Now if you go to manage jenkins , it might showing you warning that master node should not be on same server . For this add agent . 
	/home/ubuntu Remote directory
	Labels : This will be agent name . 'vinod' . 
	Lanuch method : Launch with ssh . Host : child node ip . now enter private key in jenkins master . In Kind : ssh-username . Username : ubuntu . 
	Jenkins master will contains master node private key . 
	Host key Verification strategy  : Non verifying verfication strategy . Save it . 
5. Now add public key to agent . cd  ./ssh 
	There will be authorised key . Open that file and add public key at the last of file .  Now go to the pipeline script and add agent . 
6. Now launch agent , it will start working . Now new folder will be created in child node . 


-------------------------------------------------------- Push Application Image to Docker Hub --------------------------------------------------------------
We can write build and all command in github repository seperately in groovy file format . 
Download pipeline stage plugin for good view . 
Download docker.io in child node also . sudo apt-get install docker.io

Credentials Binding for docker hub credentials . 
1. Go to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Credentials -> System -> Global Credentials (Unrestricted) 
2. Enter username and required details . Go to Docker Hub and Generate Access Token . Fill ID and this ID will be used in getting username and password . 
3. Now in script , you can use withCredentials() inbuilt function to get username and password . This complete syntax already available in Jenkins file . 

------------------------------------------------------------ Shared Library ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Shared Library in Jenkins is a centralized, reusable set of code that you can use across multiple Jenkins pipelines. Itâ€™s a way to avoid repeating the same pipeline code in every Jenkinsfile.

Think of it like a function library or a toolbox for your Jenkins pipelines. 
File of shared library in github repository should be inside 'vars' folder and file format should be in .groovy . 

To use shared library you have to use  @Library("Shared") _ at the top of pipeline script . 

1. First We have to tell Jenkins where to use shared library code . 
2. Go to Manage Jenkins -> System -> Search "Global Trusted Libraries" . 
3. cllick on Add . Fill form . Default version : branch name . 
3. Select GithubSCM and enter repository url and then save it . Code is already available in node-todo-cicd repo -> Jenkins File
