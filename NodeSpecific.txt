---------------------------------> What is libuv? (Interview Definition)

libuv is a C library used by Node.js that provides the event loop and handles asynchronous, non-blocking operations such as file I/O, networking, timers, and background 
tasks.
Node.js itself is JavaScript, but:

OS-level async I/O
Thread management
Event polling

👉 These are handled by libuv.

libuv is a C library used by Node.js that provides the event loop and handles asynchronous, non-blocking operations like file I/O, networking, timers, and
background tasks. It uses OS-level async APIs and a thread pool to execute slow operations without blocking the main JavaScript thread, allowing Node.js to
scale efficiently while remaining single-threaded at the JavaScript level.

2️⃣ Why Node.js Needs libuv
JavaScript is single-threaded.

Without libuv:
File reads would block the entire process
Network requests would block execution
Node.js wouldn’t scale

libuv allows Node.js to:
Stay single-threaded at the JS level
Still handle thousands of concurrent operations
Use OS async APIs efficiently

3️⃣ Core Responsibilities of libuv
✅ 1. Event Loop
libuv implements the event loop.
It:
Waits for async operations to complete
Pushes their callbacks to the JS execution stack
Ensures non-blocking execution

Event loop phases include:
Timers , I/O callbacks ,Poll ,Check , Close callbacks

✅ 2. Asynchronous I/O (Non-Blocking)

libuv handles:
Network I/O (TCP, HTTP, sockets) → mostly OS async
File system I/O → thread pool

Example:

fs.readFile("file.txt", callback)

Behind the scenes:
libuv sends the task to a worker thread
JS thread continues execution
Callback is queued when done
